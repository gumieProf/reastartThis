# restart This

Are you frustrated by **video restarts**?

With this Chrome extension, you can free yourself from such stress.

## How to installation

1. Enable developer mode

   Toggle the Developer Mode toggle in the extension's administration screen.

   (If you have already enabled it, proceed to the next step.)

2. Import "source" directory

   Load the extension from the "Load Unpackaged Extensions" in the Extension Management screen.

### This is all that is required to complete the installation!

## How to use

Clicking on a video in the middle of **restart** on the **YouTube site** while holding down the **R key** will play it from the beginning.

Call it **the restart button**.

## How to customise

Press **any key** on the **options screen** to make it **the activation key** for **the restart button**.

Also, **these keys** cannot be set as **the restart key** because they depend on **Chrome functionality**.
